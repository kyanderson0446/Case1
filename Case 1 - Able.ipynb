    "* The Adjusted CATE is higher because we are overestimating the impacts of weeks out from Christmas and sales. My assumption is that the model believes there is a strong causation to weeks out and increase in sales, which is why it is blown out of proportion.\n",
    "* I think we could use other features to help with the model, because we don't have the specifics of the store and we are getting confounding. There are so many reasons that Christmas would influence purchases and customer behavior. The purchasing based on weeks out on Christmas doesn't make a huge difference because people are already buying. Maybe the toy store is the only one for hundreds of miles and any sale around Christmas would be thrown out of proportion."
